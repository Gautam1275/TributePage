          <li><strong>1883</strong> - Born in Bhagur, near Nashik in Maharastra,India</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1904</strong> - In Nashik, Savarkar and his older brother Ganesh Savarkar founded the Mitra Mela,
            an underground revolutionary organization, which became <u><b>"Abhinav Bharat Society"</b></u> in 1906. 
            Abhinav Bharat's main objectives were to overthrow British rule and reviving Hindu pride.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1909</strong> - On 13 March 1910, he was arrested in London on multiple charges,
            including procurement and distribution of arms, waging war against the state, and delivering 
            seditious speeches. At the time of his arrest, he was carrying several revolutionary texts, 
            including copies of his own banned books. In addition, the British government had evidence that 
            he had smuggled 20 Browning handguns into India, one of which Anant Laxman Kanhere used to assassinate 
            the Nasik district's collector A.M.T. Jackson in December 1909.During the trial of Nasik Conspiracy Case 1910, 
            government's advocate alleged that Savarkar was a moving part and inspiration behind assassination of Jackson. 
            A Bombay court tried him in the Nasik conspiracy case and sentenced him 
            for life-imprisonment and transported him to the notorious Cellular Jail of Andaman Island and forfeited his property.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1909</strong> - In London, Savarkar got involved with organizations such as India House and the Free India Society. 
            He also published books advocating complete Indian independence by revolutionary means.One of the books he published 
            called The Indian War of Independence about <u><b>"The Indian Rebellion of 1857"</b></u> was banned by the British colonial authorities.
            Savarkar was influenced by the life and thinking of Italian Nationalist leader, Giuseppe Mazzini. During his stay in London, 
            Savarkar translated Mazzini's biography in Marathi.He also influenced thinking of a fellow student called Madanlal Dhingra. 
            In 1909, Dhingra assassinated Curzon Wyllie, a colonial officer. It is alleged by Mark Juergensmeyer that Savarkar supplied the 
            gun which Dhingra used. Juergensmeyer further alleged that Savarkar supplied the words for Dhingra's last statement before he went 
            to the gallows for the murder. Savarkar met Mohandas Gandhi for the first time in London shortly after Curzon-Wyllie's assassination. 
            During his stay, Gandhi debated Savarkar and other nationalists in London on the futility of fighting the colonial state through acts 
            of terrorism and guerilla warfare.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1911</strong> - Savarkar's arrest at Marseilles caused the French government to protest against the British, arguing that 
            the British could not recover Savarkar unless they took appropriate legal proceedings for his rendition. The dispute came before 
            the Permanent Court of International Arbitration in 1910, and it gave its decision in 1911. The case excited much controversy as 
            was reported widely by the French press, and it considered it involved an interesting international question of the right of asylum.
            The Court held, firstly, that since there was a pattern of collaboration between the two countries regarding the possibility of Savarkar's 
            escape in Marseilles and there was neither force nor fraud in inducing the French authorities to return Savarkar to them, the British 
            authorities did not have to hand him back to the French for the latter to hold rendition proceedings. On the other hand, the tribunal 
            also observed that there had been an "irregularity" in Savarkar's arrest and delivery over to the Indian Army Military Police guard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1911</strong> - Arriving in Bombay, Savarkar was taken to the Yervada Central Jail in Pune. The trial before the special tribunal 
            was started on 10 September 1910.One of the charges on Savarkar was the abetment to murder of Nashik Collector A. M. T. Jackson. 
            The second was waging a conspiracy under Indian penal code 121-A against the King Emperor.Following the two trials, Savarkar, 
            then aged 28, was convicted and sentenced to 50-years imprisonment and transported on 4 July 1911 to the infamous Cellular Jail in 
            the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He was considered by the British government as a political prisoner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1913</strong> - Savarkar submitted his next clemency petition on 14 November 1913 and presented it personally to the Home Member
             of the Governor General's council, Sir Reginald Craddock.In his letter, he described himself as a "prodigal son" longing to return to 
             the "parental doors of the government".[a] He wrote that his release from the jail will recast the faith of many Indians in the British rule. 
             Also, he said "Moreover, my conversion to the constitutional line would bring back all those misled young men in India and abroad who were once 
             looking up to me as their guide. I am ready to serve the government in any capacity they like, for as my conversion is conscientious so I hope my 
             future conduct would be. By keeping me in jail, nothing can be got in comparison to what would be otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1917</strong> - In 1917, Savarkar submitted another clemency petition, this time for a general amnesty of all political prisoners. 
            Savarkar was informed on 1 February 1918 that the clemency petition was placed before the British colonial government.
            In December 1919, there was a Royal proclamation by King George V. The Paragraph 6 of this proclamation included a declaration of Royal 
            clemency to political offenders. In view of Royal proclamation, Savarkar submitted his fourth clemency petition to the British 
            colonial government on 30 March 1920,in which he stated that "So far from believing in the militant school of the Bukanin type, 
            I do not contribute even to the peaceful and philosophical anarchism of a Kuropatkin  or a Tolstoy. And as to my revolutionary 
            tendencies in the past- it is not only now for the object of sharing the clemency but years before this have I informed of and written 
            to the Government in my petitions (1918, 1914) about my firm intention to abide by the constitution and stand by it as soon as a beginning 
            was made to frame it by Mr. Montagu. Since that the Reforms and then the Proclamation have only confirmed me in my views and recently 
            I have publicly avowed my faith in and readiness to stand by the side of orderly and constitutional development."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1920</strong> - This petition was rejected on 12 July 1920 by the British colonial government.
            After considering the petition, the British colonial government contemplated releasing Ganesh Savarkar 
            but not Vinayak Savarkar. The rationale for doing so was stated as follows.

            It may be observed that if Ganesh is released and Vinayak is retained in custody, 
            the latter will become in some measure a hostage for the former, who will see 
            that his own misconduct does not jeopardize his brother's chances of release at some future date.
            Savarkar signed a statement endorsing his trial, verdict, and British law, and renouncing violence, a bargain for freedom. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1921</strong> - On 2 May 1921, the Savarkar brothers were transferred from Andaman to mainland India with Vinayak 
            being sent to a jail in Ratnagiri, and Ganesh to Bijapur Jail. During his incarceration in Ratnagiri jail in 1922, 
            Vinayak wrote his "Essentials of Hindutva" that formulated his theory of Hindutva.Ganesh (Babarao) Savarkar was 
            unconditionally released from jail in 1922.On 6 January 1924 Vinayak was released, but was restricted to Ratnagiri District. 
            Soon after his release, he started working on the consolidation of Hindu society or Hindu Sangathan.The colonial authorities 
            provided a bungalow for him and he was allowed visitors.During his internment, he met influential people such as Mahatma Gandhi 
            and B. R. Ambedkar.[citation needed] Nathuram Godse, who later assassinated Gandhi, also met Savarkar for the first time as 
            a nineteen-year-old in 1929.Savarkar became a prolific writer during his years of restricted freedom in Ratnagiri. His publishers, 
            however, needed to have a disclaimer that they were wholly divorced from politics. Savarkar remained restricted to Ratnagiri district until 1937. 
            At that time, he was unconditionally released by the newly elected government of Bombay presidency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Savarkar as president of the Hindu Mahasabha, during the Second World War, advanced the slogan "Hinduize all Politics and Militarize Hindudom" 
            and decided to support the British war effort in India seeking military training for the Hindus.When the Congress launched the Quit India movement in 1942, 
            Savarkar criticised it and asked Hindus to stay active in the war effort and not disobey the government he also urged the Hindus to enlist in 
            the armed forces to learn the "arts of war".
          </li>
          <li><strong>1948</strong> - Following the assassination of Gandhi on 30 January 1948, police arrested the assassin Nathuram Godse and his alleged accomplices and 
            conspirators. He was a member of the Hindu Mahasabha and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Godse was the editor of Agrani Hindu Rashtra, 
            a Marathi daily from Pune which was run by the company "The Hindu Rashtra Prakashan Ltd" (The Hindu Nation Publications). This company had contributions from such 
            eminent persons as Gulabchand Hirachand, Bhalji Pendharkar, and Jugalkishore Birla. Savarkar had invested ₹ 15000 in the company. Savarkar, a former president of 
            the Hindu Mahasabha, was arrested on 5 February 1948, from his house in Shivaji Park, and kept under detention in the Arthur Road Prison, Bombay. He was charged with murder, 
            conspiracy to murder, and abetment to murder. A day before his arrest, Savarkar in a public written statement, as reported in The Times of India, Bombay dated 7 February 1948, 
            termed Gandhi's assassination a fratricidal crime, endangering India's existence as a nascent nation.The mass of papers seized from his house had revealed nothing that could remotely 
            be connected with Gandhi's murder.Due to lack of evidence, Savarkar was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1956</strong> - In 1956, he opposed B. R. Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism calling it a "useless act", to which Ambedkar responded by publicly questioning the use of epithet <b><u>"Veer"</u></b> 
            (meaning brave) by Savarkar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1957</strong> - On 22 November 1957, Raja Mahendra Pratap moved a bill in Lok Sabha to recognise the service to the country of people like Vir Savarkar, Barindra Kumar Ghosh and Bhupendranath Datta. 
            But the bill was defeated with 48 votes favouring it and 75 against it. This bill was also supported by communist leader like A. K. Gopalan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1963</strong> - On 8 November 1963, Savarkar's wife, Yamunabai, died. On 1 February 1966, Savarkar renounced medicines, food, 
            and water which was termed as prayopavesha (fast until death).Before his death, he had written an article titled <b>"Atmahatya Nahi Atmaarpan"</b>
             in which he argued that when one's life mission is over and the ability to serve society is left no more, it is better to end the life at will rather 
             than waiting for death. His condition was described to have become as "extremely serious" before his death on 26 February 1966 at his residence in 
             Bombay (now Mumbai), and that he faced difficulty in breathing; efforts to revive him failed, and was declared dead at 11:10 a.m. (IST) that day. 
             Prior to his death, Savarkar had asked his relatives to perform only his funeral and do away with the rituals of the 10th and 13th day of the Hindu faith.
             Accordingly, his last rites were performed at an electric crematorium in Bombay's Sonapur locality by his son Vishwas the following day.
